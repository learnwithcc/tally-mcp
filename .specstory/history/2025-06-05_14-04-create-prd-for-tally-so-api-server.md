# Create PRD for Tally.so API server (2025-06-05 10:04:31)

_**User**_

I want to create a cloud-hosted model context protocol server to interact with Tally.so's API. The primary goal is helping the user create and modify forms through natural language.

The server should be deployable in the cloud. I've included a complete reference guide that you can investigate here: @/Building and Deploying Cloud-Based MCP Servers 

Here's Tally's API documentation:
@https://developers.tally.so/api-reference/introduction 

Please help me create a complete PRD in `.taskmaster/docs/prd.txt` 

You can base it on the template here: @example_prd.txt

I'll create a comprehensive PRD for your Tally.so MCP server project. Let me analyze the requirements and create a detailed product requirements document.
