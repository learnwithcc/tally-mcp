# Continue with task 16 (2025-06-09 22:51:27)

_**User**_

Please continue with task 16

---

_**Assistant**_



---

I'll check the details of task 16 to understand what needs to be done.

---



---

Now let me check the current status of the dependency (task 14) to see if it's completed:

---



---

Perfect! Task 14 is completed, so we can proceed with task 16. Let me expand this task to break it down into manageable subtasks for SSE connection testing and MCP client integration verification.

---



---

Great! I've broken down task 16 into 6 manageable subtasks. Now let me get the next available subtask to work on:

---



---

Perfect! Now I can see that subtask 16.1 "Automated SSE Connection Establishment and Handshake Testing" is the first subtask to work on since it has no dependencies. Let me start by understanding the current SSE implementation and then create comprehensive tests for it.

First, let me set the subtask status to in-progress and examine the current codebase:

---



---

Now let me examine the current SSE implementation in the codebase:

---

Read file: src/index.ts

---

Now let me examine the main server implementation to understand the SSE handling:

---

Read file: src/server.ts

---

Let me read the SSE connection handling section:

---

Read file: src/server.ts

---

Let me also look at the route setup to understand the SSE endpoint:

---

Read file: src/server.ts

---

Now I need to examine the existing test structure to understand how to create comprehensive SSE connection tests. Let me check the current test setup:

---

<details>
            <summary>Listed directory src/__tests__ • **9** results</summary>
        
| Name |
|-------|
| 📄 `workflow.integration.test.ts` |
| 📄 `TallyApiClient.test.ts` |
| 📄 `TallyApiClient.integration.test.ts` |
| 📄 `health-check.test.ts` |
| 📄 `error-handling-logging.test.ts` |
| 📄 `middleware-sse.test.ts` |
| 📄 `server-lifecycle.test.ts` |
| 📄 `setup.ts` |
| 📄 `server.test.ts` |

</details>

---

I notice there's already a `middleware-sse.test.ts` file. Let me examine it to see what's already covered:

---

Read file: src/__tests__/middleware-sse.test.ts

---

Let me see the rest of this file:

---

Read file: src/__tests__/middleware-sse.test.ts

---

Now I understand the current test coverage. The existing `middleware-sse.test.ts` provides basic SSE testing, but it's quite limited. I need to create a comprehensive test file that covers the specific requirements of subtask 16.1. Let me update the subtask with my findings and then create the comprehensive tests:

---



---

Now let me create a comprehensive SSE connection and handshake test file that covers the specific requirements for MCP client integration:

---



---

Let me create the file differently by first checking if it exists:

---

<details>
            <summary>Searched codebase "sse-connection-handshake.test.ts" • **1** results</summary>
        
| File |
|------|
| `undefined` |

</details>

---

The file doesn't exist yet, so I need to create it. Let me use the edit_file tool to create it:

---



---

Let me try creating the file using a different approach by using the edit_file tool without a conditional check:

---

```bash
touch src/__tests__/sse-connection-handshake.test.ts
```

```
╰─ ^[[200~touch src/__tests__/sse-connection-handshake.test.ts^[[201~

╭─     ~/dev/projects/tally-mcp     main ············································· ✔  22:55:40   
╰─ touch sr
```

---

Now let me add the content to the file:

---



---

Let me check if there's a permissions or file issue:

---

```bash
ls -la src/__tests__/sse-connection-handshake.test.ts
```

```
❯ ls -la src/__tests__/sse-connection-handshake.test.ts
Size Date Modified    Name
 18k 2025-06-09 22:56  src/__tests__/sse-connection-handshake.test.ts


╭─     ~/dev/projects/tally-mcp     main ?2 ·········································· ✔  22:56:54   
╰─
```

---

Great! The file was created successfully. Let me check its contents to see if the edit worked:

---

Read file: src/__tests__/sse-connection-handshake.test.ts

---

Perfect! The comprehensive test file has been created successfully. Now let me run the new tests to verify they work properly:

---

```bash
npm test -- --testPathPattern=sse-connection-handshake.test.ts --verbose
```

```
❯ npm test -- --testPathPattern=sse-connection-handshake.test.ts --verbose

> tally-mcp@1.0.0 test
> jest --testPathPattern=sse-connection-handshake.test.ts --verbose

I can see several issues with the tests that need to be fixed:

1. **503 errors**: The server is becoming unhealthy during tests
2. **SSE message handling**: The EventSource events aren't being captured properly
3. **Heartbeat timeout**: The heartbeat test is timing out
4. **Invalid message handling**: Error responses don't match expected format

Let me update the subtask with the test results and fix the issues:

Now let me fix the most critical issues in the test file. First, I need to fix the MockMCPClient event handling and server health issues:
