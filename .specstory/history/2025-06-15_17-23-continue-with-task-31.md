# Continue with task 31 (2025-06-15 13:23:39)

_**User**_

Please continue with task 31

---

_**Assistant**_



---

I'll check what task 31 is and its current status to continue working on it.

---



---

I can see task 31 is about fixing model interface type mismatches in test suites. Let me check the current status of task 23 first to make sure its dependencies are satisfied, and then start working on this task.

---



---

Great! I can see that task 23 is done and task 31 has no dependencies blocked. Task 31 is about fixing model interface type mismatches in test suites. Based on the description, this relates to issues with ShareLinkType enum, FormPublicationSettings, EmbedCodeSettings, and TeamMember/TeamResponse interfaces that were identified during the comprehensive unit testing work.

Let me set task 31 to "in-progress" and start by analyzing the current state of the codebase to understand the specific type mismatches:

---



---

Now let me start by running the current tests to see what type mismatches exist:

---

```bash
npm test -- --testPathPattern="FormSharingTool|TeamManager" --verbose
```

```
╰─ ^[[200~npm test -- --testPathPattern="FormSharingTool|TeamManager" --verbose^[[201~

╭─     ~/dev/projects/tally-mcp     develop ·········································· ✔  13:24:25   
╰─ npm test -
```

---

Let me try running the tests more specifically:

---

```bash
npm test -- --testPathPattern="form-sharing-tool|team-manager" --verbose
```

```
❯ npm test -- --testPathPattern="form-sharing-tool|team-manager" --verbose

> tally-mcp@1.0.0 test
> jest --testPathPattern=form-sharing-tool|team-manager --verbose

Perfect! I can see the current type mismatch issues. Let me analyze the specific problems:

---



---

Let me examine the current model interfaces and implementation to understand the type mismatches:

---

Read file: src/models/index.ts

---

Read file: src/models/form-sharing-models.ts

---



---

Now let me check the FormSharingTool implementation to see how it handles the ShareLinkType enum:

---

Read file: src/tools/form-sharing-tool.ts

---

Let me check the generateShareLink method specifically:

---

Read file: src/tools/form-sharing-tool.ts

---



---

Now let me check how the FormPublicationService actually generates the share link result to understand the type mismatch:

---

Read file: src/services/form-publication-service.ts

---



---

Let me check the generateShareLink method to see how it determines the share link type:

---

Read file: src/services/form-publication-service.ts

---



---

Now let me check the failing tests to better understand what needs to be fixed:

---

Read file: src/tools/__tests__/form-sharing-tool.test.ts

---



---

Let me check the mock data to see what `mockShareLinkResult` contains:

---

Read file: src/tools/__tests__/form-sharing-tool.test.ts

---



---

Now I can see the issue! In the test, `mockShareLinkResult` has `type: ShareLinkType.STANDARD`, but the test is expecting the message to say "DIRECT". Let me also check the error handling pattern issue. Let me examine the error handling tests:

---

Read file: src/tools/__tests__/form-sharing-tool.test.ts

---



---

Perfect! Now I understand the issues clearly. Let me update the task with my progress and start fixing the type mismatches:

---



---



---

Let me update the task instead since it doesn't have subtasks:

---



---



---

Now let me start fixing the issues. First, let's fix the FormSharingTool test mock data:

---



---



---

I see that fixing the ShareLinkType has exposed the deeper issue mentioned in the task description - the mock data structures don't match the updated interfaces. Let me fix the mock data structures systematically:

---



---



---

Now let me fix the EmbedCodeSettings mock:

---



---

Now let me fix the ShareLinkResult mock to match the interface:

---



---



---

Given the extensive number of interface mismatches, let me run the test now to see if the key fix (ShareLinkType) has resolved the main failing test, and then address error handling:

---

```bash
npm test -- --testPathPattern="form-sharing-tool" --testNamePattern="should generate share link successfully"
```

Perfect! Now I can see the error handling pattern issue clearly. The implementation currently catches Zod validation errors and returns `{success: false, error: string}` objects, but the tests expect the methods to throw exceptions. 

I need to decide which pattern to use. Based on the task description, I should standardize this. Looking at the current implementation, it's designed to return error objects rather than throw, which is a common API pattern. I think the tests should be updated to match this pattern rather than changing the implementation to throw.

Let me update the tests to expect error objects instead of thrown exceptions:

Now let me fix the other two error handling tests:
