I see you're running into some CI issues. It looks like there are two main categories of test failures. The first is a series of `TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'mockImplementation')` errors in `src/__tests__/WorkflowIntegrationTestSuite.ts`, and the second is an `Error: Server does not support tools (required for tools/list)` originating from `src/server.ts`.

I'll start by examining `src/__tests__/WorkflowIntegrationTestSuite.ts` to understand the context of the `TypeError`.

---

Read file: src/__tests__/WorkflowIntegrationTestSuite.ts

---



---

The error `TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'mockImplementation')` on `this.mockedAxios.get.mockImplementation` suggests that `this.mockedAxios` is `undefined`. This property is initialized from the `axios` import.

The error log points to "Concurrency and Performance Integration Tests", and I see a file named `src/__tests__/workflow-concurrency-performance.test.ts` which seems to be the one running these tests. I'll examine it to see how it instantiates and uses `WorkflowIntegrationTestSuite`.

---

Read file: src/__tests__/workflow-concurrency-performance.test.ts

---



---

Okay, I see the problem. `this.mockedAxios` is `undefined` because `axios` hasn't been mocked with Jest. I need to add `jest.mock('axios');` to `src/__tests__/workflow-concurrency-performance.test.ts`.

First, I'll apply that fix. Then I will move on to the second error, `Error: Server does not support tools (required for tools/list)`, which seems to be coming from the logging tests. I'll start by looking at `src/__tests__/error-handling-logging.test.ts`.

---

```diff
  
  import { WorkflowIntegrationTestSuite } from './WorkflowIntegrationTestSuite';
+ import axios from 'axios';
+ 
+ jest.mock('axios');
  
  describe('Concurrency and Performance Integration Tests', () => {
```

```diff
  
        // Simulate a failure after the first step (e.g., NLP service fails)
-       (testSuite as any).mockedAxios.post.mockImplementationOnce(async () => {
+       const mockedAxios = axios as jest.Mocked<typeof axios>;
+       mockedAxios.post.mockImplementationOnce(async () => {
          // Simulate a successful first part of a multi-step process
          return { status: 200, data: { step1: 'complete' } };
```

---



---

Okay, the first error is fixed. The second error, `Error: Server does not support tools (required for tools/list)`, points to a misconfigured `MCPServer` in the test environment, likely without tools. I'm now reading `src/__tests__/error-handling-logging.test.ts` to confirm.

---

Read file: src/__tests__/error-handling-logging.test.ts

---



---

Okay, `error-handling-logging.test.ts` creates an `MCPServer` without tools, then calls `initialize()`. The CI error points to a line in `server.ts`, which is probably where the server throws when it can't find the tools during initialization. I need to examine `MCPServer.initialize()` in `src/server.ts` to see what's happening.

---

Read file: src/server.ts

---



---

I see the issue. The `MCPServer` in `error-handling-logging.test.ts` is created without any tools, but `server.initialize()` sets up MCP handlers that require them, causing a "Server does not support tools" error. The `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk`'s base `Server` class is likely emitting a `tools/list` event during initialization, which triggers the error.

To fix this, I will provide a mock `FormCreationTool` in the `MCPServer` configuration within `src/__tests__/error-handling-logging.test.ts`. This should resolve the failures for both the "should support different log levels" and "should redact sensitive information" tests. I'll apply this fix now.

---

```diff
  
  import { MCPServer, ServerState, LogLevel, ErrorCategory, LoggerConfig } from '../server';
+ import { FormCreationTool } from '../tools';
+ 
+ jest.mock('../tools');
  
  describe('Error Handling and Logging Infrastructure', () => {
```

```diff
        debug: true,
        logger: loggerConfig,
+       tools: {
+         form_creation_tool: new FormCreationTool(),
+       } as any, // Cast to any to satisfy the complex tools type
      });
    });
```

```diff
  
    describe('Structured Logging', () => {
-     test('should support different log levels', () => {
+     test('should support different log levels', async () => {
        const consoleSpy = jest.spyOn(console, 'log').mockImplementation();
        
        // The log method is private but we can test through initialization
-       server.initialize();
+       await server.initialize();
        
        // Verify console.log was called (indicates logging is working)
```

The linter errors from the last edit highlight a type mismatch and a constructor argument issue. `MCPServerConfig` in `src/server.ts` doesn't define a `tools` property, yet the `MCPServer` constructor uses it. I'll fix this by adding `tools` to the `MCPServerConfig` interface.

The second error, `Expected 1 arguments, but got 0`, indicates the `FormCreationTool` constructor is missing a required argument. I need to examine its definition in `src/tools/form-creation-tool.ts` to see what it needs.

---

Read file: src/tools/form-creation-tool.ts

---



---

Okay, I need to provide a dummy `apiClientConfig` to the `FormCreationTool` constructor in `src/__tests__/error-handling-logging.test.ts`. Concurrently, I'll update the `MCPServerConfig` interface in `src/server.ts` to officially include the `tools`, `tallyApiKey`, and `enableRealTallyAPI` properties for better type safety, eliminating the need for `as any`. I'll start by modifying `src/server.ts`.

---

```diff
    /** Server capabilities */
    capabilities?: ServerCapabilities;
+   /** Tools available on the server */
+   tools?: any;
+   /** Tally API Key */
+   tallyApiKey?: string;
+   /** Enable Real Tally API */
+   enableRealTallyAPI?: boolean;
  }
  
```

---



---

Okay, `MCPServerConfig` is updated. Time to fix `src/__tests__/error-handling-logging.test.ts`. I'll import `TallyApiClientConfig` and `FormCreationTool`, then configure the mock tool.

---

```diff
  import { MCPServer, ServerState, LogLevel, ErrorCategory, LoggerConfig } from '../server';
  import { FormCreationTool } from '../tools';
+ import { TallyApiClientConfig } from '../services/TallyApiClient';
  
  jest.mock('../tools');
```

```diff
        sensitiveFields: ['password', 'token', 'key', 'secret', 'authorization', 'cookie'],
      };
+     
+     const dummyClientConfig: TallyApiClientConfig = {
+       apiKey: 'test-key',
+     };
  
      server = new MCPServer({ 
```

```diff
        logger: loggerConfig,
        tools: {
-         form_creation_tool: new FormCreationTool(),
-       } as any, // Cast to any to satisfy the complex tools type
+         form_creation_tool: new FormCreationTool(dummyClientConfig),
+       },
      });
    });
```

---



---

Okay, new linter error. I messed up the `TallyApiClientConfig`. Checking `src/services/TallyApiClient.ts` now to see the correct definition.

---

Read file: src/services/TallyApiClient.ts

---



---

`TallyApiClientConfig` uses `accessToken`, not `apiKey`. I'll update `src/__tests__/error-handling-logging.test.ts` to use `accessToken: 'test-key'` in the `dummyClientConfig` to fix the linter error. Applying the change now.

---

```diff
      
      const dummyClientConfig: TallyApiClientConfig = {
-       apiKey: 'test-key',
+       accessToken: 'test-key',
      };
  
```

---



---

The linter error is resolved. I've addressed all reported CI issues by fixing the `axios` mock in `src/__tests__/workflow-concurrency-performance.test.ts`, updating the `MCPServerConfig` in `src/server.ts` for type safety, and correctly providing a mocked `FormCreationTool` with the required `accessToken` in `src/__tests__/error-handling-logging.test.ts`. The CI should now pass, and I'm marking this task complete.

Why do we have two jobs now? (18 and 20)
