# Tally MCP Server: Complete Debugging & Testing Initiative

## Project Overview
The Tally MCP (Model Context Protocol) server project has encountered critical issues requiring comprehensive root cause analysis, systematic testing, and resolution. This initiative will establish a robust debugging framework and comprehensive testing suite to identify and resolve all issues preventing proper operation.

## Current State & Problems
- Project has "gone off the rails" with undefined critical failures
- Previous debugging efforts documented in DEBUGGING_SUMMARY.md
- SSE timeout problems and Cursor configuration issues previously identified
- Cloudflare Workers deployment with potential transport layer issues
- Unknown authentication, API integration, or protocol compliance problems

## Success Criteria

### Phase 1: Foundation Analysis (Critical Priority)
1. **Diagnostic Infrastructure**: All diagnostic tools operational and providing clear system health status
2. **Root Cause Identification**: Clear identification of primary failure modes causing system instability
3. **Environment Validation**: All configuration, environment variables, and dependencies verified as correct
4. **Basic Functionality**: MCP server starts, registers tools, and establishes connections successfully

### Phase 2: Comprehensive Testing (High Priority)  
5. **API Integration**: All Tally.so API endpoints working with proper authentication and data transformation
6. **Protocol Compliance**: Full MCP specification compliance with proper JSON-RPC message handling
7. **Transport Layer**: Reliable SSE connections with proper timeout handling and recovery
8. **Client Integration**: Successful integration with MCP clients (Claude Desktop, Cursor)

### Phase 3: Production Readiness (Medium Priority)
9. **Performance**: System operates within acceptable performance parameters under normal and peak loads
10. **Reliability**: Error handling, recovery mechanisms, and monitoring infrastructure operational
11. **Security**: Authentication, authorization, and data protection mechanisms verified
12. **Maintainability**: Comprehensive test suite, documentation, and debugging tools available

- **Dependency Checker**: Package compatibility and security validation

### Testing Framework Required
- **Unit Testing**: Individual component testing with >90% code coverage
- **Integration Testing**: API workflow and data transformation testing
- **Protocol Testing**: MCP specification compliance validation
- **End-to-End Testing**: Complete user workflow validation

- **Security Testing**: Authentication and authorization validation
- **Regression Testing**: Prevention of previously resolved issues

### Infrastructure Required
- **Monitoring System**: Real-time system health and performance monitoring
- **Alerting System**: Proactive notification of system issues
- **Logging Framework**: Comprehensive, structured logging at all system levels
- **Documentation System**: Up-to-date technical documentation and runbooks
- **Deployment Pipeline**: Reliable, tested deployment to Cloudflare Workers

## Core Components to Test

### MCP Server Architecture
- Tool registration and discovery mechanisms
- JSON-RPC message handling and protocol compliance
- Capability negotiation between clients and server
- Error handling for malformed requests and protocol violations
- Resource cleanup and memory management

### Tally.so API Integration
- Authentication flow and token management
- All API endpoints (forms, submissions, responses)
- Rate limiting compliance and backoff strategies
- Error response handling (4xx, 5xx status codes)
- Data transformation between Tally and MCP formats

### Transport Layer (SSE)
- Connection establishment and maintenance
- Timeout handling and recovery mechanisms
- Message queuing and delivery reliability
- Cross-origin request handling (CORS)
- Connection state monitoring and debugging

### Cloudflare Workers Environment
- Cold start performance and initialization
- Worker timeout behavior under various loads
- Memory usage patterns and resource limits
- Edge caching behavior and regional consistency
- Environment variable and configuration management

## Technical Implementation

### Technology Stack
- **Runtime**: Cloudflare Workers (Edge Runtime)
- **Protocol**: Model Context Protocol (MCP) 
- **Transport**: Server-Sent Events (SSE)
- **API Integration**: Tally.so REST API
- **Testing**: Jest with custom MCP testing utilities
- **Monitoring**: Structured logging with performance metrics
- **Deployment**: Wrangler CLI with automated CI/CD

### Authentication & Security
- Secure API key management for Tally.so
- CORS configuration for cross-origin requests
- Input validation and sanitization
- Rate limiting and abuse prevention
- SSL/TLS certificate validation

### Performance Requirements
- Tool registration: <100ms
- API response time: <500ms (95th percentile)
- SSE connection establishment: <200ms
- Memory usage: <128MB per worker instance
- Cold start time: <50ms
