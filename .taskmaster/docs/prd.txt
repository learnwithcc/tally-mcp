# Tally.so MCP Server - Product Requirements Document

# Overview  
The Tally.so MCP Server is a cloud-hosted Model Context Protocol server that enables AI assistants to interact with Tally.so's form builder platform through natural language. This server bridges the gap between conversational AI and form management, allowing users to create, modify, and manage Tally forms using simple natural language commands within AI applications like Cursor, Claude Desktop, or other MCP-compatible clients.

The server solves the complexity of form creation by translating natural language requests into specific Tally API calls, making form building accessible to non-technical users while providing powerful automation capabilities for developers. Users can describe their form requirements in plain English and have complete, functional forms created automatically with proper validation, styling, and integration capabilities.

# Core Features  

## Natural Language Form Creation
- **Form Builder Tool**: Converts natural language descriptions into complete Tally forms with appropriate question types, validation rules, and logical flow
- **Question Generation**: Automatically generates appropriate question types (text, multiple choice, rating, file upload, etc.) based on user intent
- **Smart Field Mapping**: Intelligently maps user requirements to Tally's field types and validation options
- **Form Logic**: Implements conditional logic and branching based on natural language descriptions

## Form Management and Modification  
- **Form Editor Tool**: Allows modification of existing forms through natural language commands ("add a phone number field", "make email required")
- **Bulk Operations**: Enables batch modifications across multiple forms or form elements
- **Form Templates**: Provides pre-built form templates for common use cases (contact forms, surveys, registration forms)
- **Version Control**: Maintains form versioning and allows rollback to previous configurations

## Data and Analytics Access
- **Submission Viewer**: Retrieves and formats form submissions in readable formats for AI analysis
- **Analytics Tool**: Provides form performance metrics, completion rates, and submission analytics
- **Export Functionality**: Exports form data in various formats (CSV, JSON) for further processing
- **Real-time Monitoring**: Tracks form activity and provides live submission notifications

## Workspace and Organization Management
- **Workspace Tools**: Manages Tally workspaces, user permissions, and organizational structure
- **Collaboration Features**: Handles team member invitations, role assignments, and access control
- **Form Sharing**: Manages form publication, sharing settings, and embed code generation
- **Webhook Management**: Configures and manages webhooks for form submissions and events

# User Experience  

## Primary User Personas
- **Business Users**: Non-technical professionals who need to create forms quickly for surveys, lead generation, event registration, or feedback collection
- **Developers**: Technical users who want to integrate form creation into automated workflows or applications
- **Marketing Teams**: Teams that need to rapidly deploy landing page forms, campaign forms, and conversion tracking
- **Customer Success**: Teams managing customer onboarding, feedback collection, and support ticket creation

## Key User Flows

### Form Creation Flow
1. User describes form requirements in natural language: "Create a customer feedback form with rating questions for service quality, delivery speed, and overall satisfaction, plus a comment field"
2. MCP server analyzes the request and identifies required form elements
3. Server creates form structure using Tally API with appropriate question types
4. User receives confirmation with form URL and embed options
5. Optional: User requests modifications through follow-up natural language commands

### Form Modification Flow
1. User references existing form: "Modify the customer feedback form to add a phone number field before the comments"
2. Server retrieves current form structure from Tally API
3. Server applies requested modifications while preserving existing data and logic
4. User receives updated form confirmation with change summary

### Data Analysis Flow
1. User requests form data: "Show me all submissions from the customer feedback form from last week"
2. Server retrieves submissions using Tally API with appropriate filters
3. Server formats data for AI analysis and presents summary insights
4. User can request specific analytics or export options

## UI/UX Considerations
- **Natural Language Interface**: All interactions use conversational language rather than technical form builder terminology
- **Context Awareness**: Server maintains context about previously created or modified forms within conversation sessions
- **Error Handling**: Provides clear, actionable error messages when API limits are reached or invalid configurations are requested
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Supports both simple and complex form creation scenarios with appropriate guidance

# Technical Architecture  

## System Components

### MCP Server Core
- **Node.js/TypeScript** runtime with MCP SDK integration
- **Express.js** middleware for HTTP transport (SSE) support
- **Zod** validation for input schemas and API response validation
- **Axios** HTTP client for Tally API communication with retry logic
- **JWT** handling for Tally API authentication and token refresh

### Tool Implementations
- **Form Creation Tool**: Parses natural language, maps to Tally form schema, validates requirements
- **Form Modification Tool**: Retrieves existing forms, applies incremental changes, handles field dependencies
- **Submission Analysis Tool**: Fetches submission data, applies filtering, formats for AI consumption
- **Workspace Management Tool**: Handles organizational operations, user management, permission controls

### Authentication & Security
- **OAuth 2.0** integration with Tally's authentication system
- **API Key Management** for secure storage and rotation of Tally API credentials
- **Rate Limiting** to respect Tally's API limits and prevent abuse
- **Input Sanitization** for all user inputs to prevent injection attacks

## Data Models
