      "complexityScore": 3,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 2,
      "expansionPrompt": "Detail the steps for installing MCP Inspector, configuring connection files, setting up necessary environment variables, and documenting the process for developer reference.",
      "reasoning": "The task is primarily a configuration and documentation exercise with well-defined parameters, making it less complex than other tasks."

      "taskTitle": "Implement Mock Tally API Responses",
      "complexityScore": 7,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 3,
      "expansionPrompt": "Divide the work into subtasks that address resolving TypeScript compilation errors by aligning mock data with actual schemas, creating unit tests for the mock service, and updating documentation for toggle configurations and usage scenarios.",
      "reasoning": "This task involves complex integration challenges, error handling, and the need to simulate realistic API behavior, which raises its complexity level."

      "taskTitle": "Create Jest Test Suites for Tools and API Client",
      "complexityScore": 8,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 4,
      "expansionPrompt": "Outline subtasks for setting up a robust Jest configuration, writing and refining unit tests to cover failing cases, integrating snapshot tests for complex cases, and improving overall coverage including critical service and middleware components.",
      "reasoning": "Multiple modules with varying current coverage levels, along with significant failing tests and the need for snapshot testing, contribute to the high complexity of this task."

      "taskId": 4,
      "taskTitle": "Develop Integration Tests for User Workflows",
      "complexityScore": 7,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 3,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break this task into subtasks by identifying key user workflows, designing test scenarios for both normal and error conditions, and integrating these tests with existing mock API responses and MCP Inspector confirmations.",
      "reasoning": "End-to-end testing requires comprehensive scenario planning and thorough validation across multiple components, leading to a moderate to high complexity."

      "taskId": 5,
      "taskTitle": "Set Up Automated Testing Pipeline",
      "complexityScore": 7,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 3,
      "expansionPrompt": "Expand this task by detailing the steps to configure GitHub Actions (or similar CI/CD tools), set up separate jobs for unit, integration, and performance tests, and implement mechanisms for test results reporting and notifications.",
      "reasoning": "Integrating automated testing with performance metrics and ensuring robust CI/CD pipeline configuration adds a layer of orchestration complexity."

      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the 'Create Jest Test Suites for Tools and API Client' task into specific subtasks for each component requiring testing, including unit tests for API client methods, utility functions, form generation tools, and test coverage reporting.",
      "reasoning": "This task involves complex testing infrastructure setup with multiple components (MCP Inspector, Jest, mock services) and requires integration across various systems. The current implementation shows 5 subtasks with 3 completed and 2 pending. The test coverage analysis reveals significant gaps (54.91% overall) with 39 failing tests across 5 suites, indicating high complexity. The task requires specialized knowledge of testing frameworks, API mocking, and CI/CD integration."

      "expansionPrompt": "Divide the 'Create Deployment Guides for Cloud Platforms' task into platform-specific subtasks for Cloudflare Workers, Glama.ai, and Smithery, each with detailed configuration, deployment steps, and verification procedures.",
      "reasoning": "This documentation and deployment task has moderate complexity with 5 well-defined subtasks covering different documentation aspects. While it doesn't require deep technical implementation, it demands comprehensive knowledge across multiple deployment platforms (Cloudflare Workers, Glama.ai, Smithery), Docker containerization, and security best practices. The task requires thorough verification through testing documentation accuracy by following instructions in clean environments."
