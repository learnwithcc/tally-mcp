## Failure Details

### `sse-connection-handshake.test.ts`

*   **Failing Tests**:
    *   `should handle multiple simultaneous SSE connections`
    *   `should maintain heartbeat mechanism`
    *   `should handle invalid handshake messages gracefully`
    *   `should handle abrupt connection termination`
    *   `should handle rapid connection cycling`
*   **Error Message**: `expect(received).toBeLessThan(expected)` and `Event heartbeat not received within 35000ms`
*   **Category**: Integration
*   **Component**: SSE
*   **Priority**: High
*   **Impact**: These failures indicate a fundamental problem with the real-time communication layer of the application. Users may experience connection drops, missed updates, and an unreliable experience.
*   **Recommendation**: Investigate the SSE server implementation for potential race conditions, resource leaks, or incorrect handling of connection lifecycles. Review the test environment to ensure it can handle long-running connections and timers.

### `middleware-sse.test.ts`

*   **Failing Tests**:
    *   `should handle JSON body parsing`
    *   `should process valid MCP messages`
    *   `should reject invalid message format`
    *   `should handle missing message properties`
    *   `should handle large payloads within limits`
*   **Error Message**: `AxiosError: Request failed with status code 400`
*   **Category**: Integration
*   **Component**: Middleware
*   **Priority**: High
*   **Impact**: The middleware is failing to correctly parse and validate incoming requests. This could lead to valid requests being rejected, or invalid requests being processed, potentially causing data corruption or other downstream errors.
*   **Recommendation**: Review the middleware's JSON parsing and validation logic. Ensure that it correctly handles all expected message formats and edge cases.

### `TallyApiClient.test.ts`

*   **Failing Tests**:
    *   `should validate and return submissions response`
    *   `should throw validation error for invalid submissions response`
    *   `should validate and return form data`
    *   `should throw validation error for invalid form response`
*   **Error Message**: `expect(received).toEqual(expected)` and `expect(received).rejects.toThrow()`
*   **Category**: Unit
*   **Component**: API Client
*   **Priority**: Medium
*   **Impact**: The tests for the Tally API client are failing, which suggests that the client may not be correctly interacting with the Tally API. This could lead to incorrect data being fetched or sent to Tally.
*   **Recommendation**: Update the mock data in the tests to match the expected schema from the Tally API. This will ensure that the tests are accurately testing the client's functionality.

### `server-lifecycle.test.ts`

*   **Failing Test**: `should not allow initialization when not stopped`
*   **Error Message**: `expect(received).rejects.toThrow()`
*   **Category**: Unit
*   **Component**: Server
*   **Priority**: Medium
*   **Impact**: This failure indicates a problem with the server's state management. It may be possible to put the server into an inconsistent state, which could lead to unexpected behavior.
*   **Recommendation**: Review the server's state management logic and ensure that it correctly handles all possible state transitions.

### `security.test.ts`

*   **Failing Tests**:
    *   `should block directory traversal attempts`
    *   `should validate Content-Length header`
    *   `should reject negative Content-Length`
*   **Error Message**: `expect(received).toBe(expected)`
*   **Category**: Unit
*   **Component**: Security
*   **Priority**: High
*   **Impact**: These are critical security vulnerabilities. A malicious user could potentially exploit these vulnerabilities to gain access to sensitive files or cause a denial of service.
*   **Recommendation**: Immediately fix the security middleware to correctly handle directory traversal attempts and Content-Length validation.

### `workflow.integration.test.ts`

*   **Failing Tests**:
    *   `should create a form from a natural language prompt via MCP`
    *   `should modify a form from a natural language prompt via MCP`
    *   `should get form sharing details via MCP`
    *   `should invite a team member via MCP`
    *   `should get form submissions via MCP`
    *   `should create a form from a template via MCP`
*   **Error Message**: `expect(received).toBe(expected)`
*   **Category**: E2E
*   **Component**: Workflow
*   **Priority**: High
*   **Impact**: These failures indicate that the core workflows of the application are broken. Users will not be able to create, modify, or share forms, which is the primary functionality of the application.
*   **Recommendation**: Investigate the routing and test setup to identify the cause of the 404 errors. This is likely a configuration issue in the test environment.

### `api-key-service.test.ts`

*   **Failing Test**: `should reject key that exceeded usage limit`
*   **Error Message**: `expect(received).toBe(expected)`
*   **Category**: Unit
*   **Component**: API Key Service
*   **Priority**: High
*   **Impact**: The API key service is not correctly enforcing usage limits. This could allow users to exceed their usage limits, which could lead to unexpected costs or a degradation of service for other users.
*   **Recommendation**: Review the API key service's usage limit logic and ensure that it is correctly enforcing the limits.

## Recommendations for Test Stability

### General Recommendations

*   **Improve Test Isolation**: Ensure that tests are properly isolated from each other. Use Jest's `beforeEach` and `afterEach` hooks to set up and tear down the test environment for each test. This will help to prevent tests from interfering with each other.
*   **Use Realistic Mock Data**: Use realistic mock data that closely matches the data that the application will receive in a production environment. This will help to ensure that the tests are accurately testing the application's functionality.
*   **Improve Test Coverage**: Increase the test coverage to ensure that all parts of the application are tested. This will help to identify bugs and prevent regressions.

### Specific Recommendations

*   **Fix Security Middleware**: The security middleware is a critical component of the application, and the failing tests indicate that it is not working correctly. This should be the highest priority.
*   **Fix SSE Connection Issues**: The SSE connection issues are also a high priority, as they are affecting the real-time communication layer of the application.
*   **Fix Middleware Failures**: The middleware failures should also be a high priority, as they are affecting the core functionality of the application.
*   **Fix Workflow Integration Tests**: The workflow integration tests are failing because of 404 errors. This is likely a configuration issue in the test environment. This should be investigated and fixed.
*   **Fix API Key Service**: The API key service is not correctly enforcing usage limits. This is a serious issue that needs to be addressed.
*   **Fix Server Lifecycle Test**: The server lifecycle test is failing because the server is not correctly handling state transitions. This should be fixed to prevent the server from getting into an inconsistent state.
*   **Fix Tally API Client Tests**: The Tally API client tests are failing because of incorrect mock data. This is a relatively easy fix, but it's a good reminder to be careful when creating mock data.
