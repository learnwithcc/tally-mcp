# Security Best Practices

This document outlines security best practices for the Tally MCP Server.

## 1. Authentication

- **API Token:** The primary method of authentication is the Tally.so API token. This token should be kept secret and should not be hard-coded in the application. Use environment variables to manage the token.
- **Secrets Management:** For production deployments, use a secrets management service (like AWS Secrets Manager, Azure Key Vault, or HashiCorp Vault) to store the API token and other sensitive credentials.

## 2. Authorization

- **Granular Permissions:** Use the `FormPermissionManager` and `TeamManager` to implement granular access control. Avoid giving users more permissions than they need.
- **Principle of Least Privilege:** When assigning roles, follow the principle of least privilege. Users should only have the permissions necessary to perform their jobs.

## 3. Data Protection

- **Input Validation:** All user input should be validated and sanitized to prevent injection attacks. The server uses `zod` for schema validation, which helps ensure that data conforms to the expected format.
- **Output Encoding:** When returning data to the client, ensure that it is properly encoded to prevent XSS attacks, especially if the data is rendered in a web browser.
- **Data in Transit:** Ensure that all communication with the Tally.so API and any other external services is done over HTTPS.

## 4. Secure Deployment

- **Environment Variables:** Do not commit `.env` files with production secrets to version control. Use `.env.example` to provide a template for the required variables.
- **Docker Security:**
  - Run containers with the least privileged user.
  - Scan container images for vulnerabilities.
  - Use multi-stage builds to create lean production images with only the necessary dependencies.
- **Dependency Management:** Regularly update dependencies to patch security vulnerabilities. Use tools like `npm audit` to identify and fix known vulnerabilities.

## 5. Logging and Monitoring

- **Sensitive Data:** Be careful not to log sensitive information, such as API tokens or passwords.
- **Audit Trails:** Implement audit trails to track important events, such as permission changes or form deletions.
- **Alerting:** Set up alerts for suspicious activity, such as a high rate of failed login attempts or unauthorized access attempts.
